Hello, I am John Femiani, a professor of computer science at [Miami University](https://miamioh.edu/profiles/cec/john-femiani.html) in the beautiful [Oxford, OH](https://www.cityofoxford.org/). I am a parent of two sons and a daughter, and I have a strong interest (and B.A degree) in fine art, as well as hobbies such as weightlifting, fishing and fossil-hunting. 

## My work and research. 

I do research in computer vision and graphics, applying the latest machine learning advances to extract meaningful information from images, video, and multimodal datasets.  The goal is to get the most useful and complete semantic representation with as little training data as possible.  Of particular interest are approachs that can create useful (editable) representation of scenes based on sensory data. Common applications include remote sensing (e.g. finding rooftops in images and generating 3D buildings or street maps) as well as some topic that are just plain fun, such as automatically replacing your hair so you can try on a different style. 


## My background and history

I attended ASU in the lat 90's as a studio art major (drawing and painting) and applied to the selective computer graphics program. However, I was quickly drawn into the methods and algorithms used to represent the 3D models and animations. I was able to work with [Mars Global Surveyor Thermal Emmision Spectrometer (TES)](http://tes.asu.edu/) team at ASU and later attend graduate school working with the Partnership For Research in Spatial Modeling (PRISM) which focused on reverse engineering various 3D surfaces acquired through photogrammetry or laser scanning.  My initial research was on surface parametrization, and curve matching. My dissertation was on document image understanding by segmenting marks into handwriting vs typeset marks.  

My main interest has been in optimization and reverse engineering techniques for understanding images; and I have been able to apply them to many different domains including medical images and remote sensing applications. As deep neural networks rose to priminance I was able to to use them to solve problems such as material classificaion (remote sensing) and 3D building modeling. I have inverted generative adversarial networks (GANs) to enable image editing, and I have used language models to extract meaning from images for zero-shot or one-shot image generation tasks.
