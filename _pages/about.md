Hello, I am John Femiani, a professor of computer science at [Miami University](https://miamioh.edu/profiles/cec/john-femiani.html) in the beautiful [Oxford, OH](https://www.cityofoxford.org/). I am a parent of two sons and a daughter, and I have a strong interest (and B.A degree) in fine art, as well as hobbies such as weightlifting, fishing and fossil-hunting. 

## My work and research. 


## My background and history
