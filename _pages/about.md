I’m **John C. Femiani**, the **Armstrong Professor of Computer Science** at [Miami University](https://miamioh.edu/profiles/cec/john-femiani.html) in Oxford, OH. My research interests are in **artificial intelligence (AI)**, **machine learning (ML)**,  **computer vision**,**computer graphics**, and **remote sensing** with a focus on using advanced learning models to extract structured, meaningful representations from complex datasets such as images and video.

## Research Interests and Work

My work lies at the intersection of **AI**, **machine learning**, and **computer vision**, where I develop methods to process and understand large, multimodal datasets. I focus on algorithms that extract meaningful patterns from minimal training data, particularly in applications involving **remote sensing**, **scene reconstruction**, and **generative models**. My research aims to push the boundaries of **unsupervised** and **self-supervised learning**, enabling models to perform tasks with less reliance on large, labeled datasets.

### Core Areas of Interest:
- **Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning**: Developing AI systems that generalize with fewer examples, utilizing techniques such as **one-shot** and **zero-shot learning**. I aim to create models that learn efficiently from limited data.
- **Computer Vision**: From detecting structures like buildings and roads in satellite imagery to generating 3D models from 2D data, my work addresses how machines can interpret and interact with visual information.
- **Generative Models**: My recent work involves leveraging **GANs** and **transformers** for **scene generation** and **image manipulation**, including projects that enable interactive, real-time editing of images using minimal user input.

These efforts tie into a broader goal: creating models that can operate effectively with less supervision and more autonomy, mimicking human cognitive processes in understanding complex scenes.

## Academic Background

My academic path began at **Arizona State University (ASU)**, where I initially pursued a degree in **fine arts**. However, my interests quickly shifted to the technical aspects of **3D modeling** and **computer graphics**, and I transitioned to computer science.

I later joined the **Partnership for Research in Spatial Modeling (PRISM)**, where my work focused on **surface parameterization** and the **analysis of 3D geometric structures**. My **dissertation** revolved around the problem of **document image understanding**, specifically the segmentation of handwritten versus typeset marks.

## Research Milestones:

- **Surface Parameterization**: Early work in 3D surface analysis, developing mathematical models for representing complex surfaces.
- **Document Image Understanding**: Research on segmenting and classifying mixed-content documents using optimization techniques.
- **Remote Sensing Applications**: Developing algorithms for extracting urban features (e.g., roads, rooftops) from satellite imagery, contributing to **3D reconstruction** and **urban modeling**.
- **Generative AI Research**: Focused on **multimodal generative models**, initially on **GANs** and now **diffusion models**. Current work explores the use of **large language models (LLMs)** to enhance **computer vision tasks**, enabling richer semantic understanding and control in visual data generation.



## Advancing AI and Machine Learning

With the rise of deep learning, I have expanded my work to focus on how **neural networks** can be applied to problems in **image classification**, **material recognition**, and **3D scene modeling**. I am particularly interested in **inverting generative models** like GANs to allow **interactive editing** of scenes and objects.

More recently, I’ve been exploring **transformer-based architectures** and how they can integrate **language models** with **visual data** for tasks such as **zero-shot image classification**. This fusion of vision and language aims to improve the interpretability and usability of AI systems in real-world applications.

## Personal Interests

While much of my time is devoted to research, I also enjoy **weightlifting**, **fishing**, and **fossil-hunting**. These activities provide a balance between my academic pursuits and personal interests, offering me a way to stay connected with the natural world and physical well-being.
