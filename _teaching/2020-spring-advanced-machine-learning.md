This graduate-level course offers an in-depth theoretical exploration of machine learning, with a focus on both classical and modern techniques. Grounded in Bishop's *Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning* (PRML), this course delves into the probabilistic and mathematical foundations of machine learning, making it distinct from the undergraduate applied courses.

### Key Topics:
- **Probabilistic Models**: Bayesian networks, Markov models, and graphical models.
- **Bayesian Learning**: Bayesian inference and variational methods.
- **Advanced Neural Networks**: CNNs, RNNs, GANs, and deep generative models.
- **Theoretical Treatment**: In-depth analysis of optimization, overfitting, regularization, and model complexity.
- **Reinforcement Learning**: Policy gradients and advanced decision-making algorithms.

The course emphasizes building machine learning algorithms from scratch and applying them to complex datasets, distinguishing it from undergraduate courses which focus more on practical applications using libraries.

### Textbook:
- Christopher M. Bishop, *Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning* (PRML)
