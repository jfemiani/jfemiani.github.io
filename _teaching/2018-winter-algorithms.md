This course focuses on the analysis and design of algorithms, with cross-listed sections for both undergraduate (CSE464) and graduate students (CSE564). The curriculum covers foundational topics such as dynamic programming, graph algorithms, and NP-completeness, along with an introduction to approximation algorithms.

Graduate students are expected to tackle more challenging problems and complete a research-based project that delves into advanced topics such as approximation algorithms or solving NP-hard problems.

### Key Topics:
- Divide and conquer algorithms
- Dynamic programming
- Graph algorithms (e.g., shortest path, network flows)
- NP-completeness
- Approximation algorithms (for CSE564)

### Graduate-Level Requirements:
Students in CSE564 are required to work on additional assignments and submit a research-driven project.
