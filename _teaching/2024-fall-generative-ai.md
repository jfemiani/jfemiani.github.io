This course introduces the fundamental concepts and techniques of Generative AI, with a focus on language models, neural networks, and creative AI systems. Students will explore state-of-the-art generative models such as GANs, transformers, and VAEs, and learn how to apply these techniques to real-world problems. Emphasis is placed on prompt engineering, model fine-tuning, and evaluation.

Graduate students will have additional expectations, including advanced readings, leading discussions, and completing a more substantial final project.

### Key Topics:
- GANs, transformers, VAEs
- Prompt engineering
- Fine-tuning models
- Text and image generation

### Graduate-Level Requirements:
Graduate students are required to lead discussions and complete a research project involving a deeper exploration of Generative AI frameworks.
