This graduate course explores advanced topics in algorithms, with an emphasis on NP-hard problems, approximation algorithms, and advanced techniques for solving optimization problems. Students will focus on proving algorithm correctness and analyzing their complexity. Topics include probabilistic methods, approximation algorithms, and advanced graph algorithms.

### Key Topics:
- NP-hardness and reductions
- Approximation algorithms
- Randomized algorithms
- Advanced dynamic programming techniques
- Graph algorithms (min-cut, max-flow)
- Heuristics for real-world problems

Graduate students are required to engage with research-level algorithmic challenges and complete a project that applies advanced algorithms to a complex real-world problem.
