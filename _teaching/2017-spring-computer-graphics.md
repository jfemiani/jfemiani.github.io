This course introduces students to the principles of computer graphics, including rasterization, ray tracing, 3D transformations, and shading techniques. Both undergraduate and graduate students are exposed to the mathematics and programming involved in rendering 3D scenes and developing computer graphics applications.

### Key Topics:
- Rasterization and ray tracing
- 3D transformations and projections
- Shading and lighting models
- GPU programming with OpenGL

Graduate students (CSE566) have additional assignments and a research-based project focusing on advanced topics such as GPU optimization or procedural modeling.
